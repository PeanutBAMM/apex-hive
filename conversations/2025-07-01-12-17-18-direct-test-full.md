- a1a11db fix: Remove old cache system and improve cache warmi

### Scope of Changes

The session involved modifications to 8 files across the codebase. Key areas of focus included:

- **Scripts** (4 files): Core functionality and automation scripts
- **Configuration** (3 files): System configuration and settings
- **Modules** (1 files): Shared modules and utilities

### Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges addressed in this session was implementing an effective conversation memory system. We explored different approaches for storing and retrieving conversation data, ultimately focusing on a unified solution that leverages both filesystem storage and caching for optimal performance.

Several issues were identified and resolved during this session, improving the overall stability and functionality of the codebase.

### Development Workflow

The session followed a structured development workflow:

- **Apex commands** (1): Used for automation and task execution

### Key Topics

The main areas of focus during this session included: **apex**, **router**, **patterns**, **registry**, **generate**, **claude**, **install**, **server**, **debug**, **fixed**.

### Summary

This was a productive session with 6 significant actions taken, affecting 8 files. The changes made today contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the project.
