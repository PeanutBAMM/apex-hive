# Rollback Report - 2025-01-06

## Overview
Rolling back from commit `4519fd2` to `23509f2` due to performance degradation in recipe execution.

## What We Tried to Implement

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow (`feature-branch-workflow`)

**Goal**: Automate the complete GitHub feature branch workflow
- Create commits
- Run tests  
- Push to remote
- Create PR
- Check PR status
- Merge PR
- Switch back to master
- Create new branch

**Implementation**:
- Created 4 new git scripts:
  - `git-pr-create.js` - Create GitHub PRs with auto-generated title/body
  - `git-pr-status.js` - Check PR status and cache PR number
  - `git-pr-merge.js` - Merge PRs with configurable options
  - `git-checkout-master.js` - Switch to main branch
  - `git-branch-new.js` - Create new feature branches

**Problems Encountered**:
1. **Interactive Mode Issues**: Scripts waited for user input in MCP environment
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: 
   - `git-pr-merge` could wait up to 10 minutes for CI checks
   - Scripts executed git commands before dry-run checks
   - Recipe execution hung indefinitely
3. **MCP Environment Incompatibility**: No TTY available for readline interfaces

**Attempted Fixes**:
- Added early dry-run returns to all scripts
- Set `interactive: false` and `waitForChecks: false` as defaults
- Added process.stdin.isTTY checks
- Modified git-pr-create to use `stdio: "pipe"` instead of `"inherit"`

**Result**: Scripts became unresponsive even for simple operations like `full-close`

### 2. Doc Scripts Quality Enhancement (`doc-scripts-quality-enhancer`)

**Previous Work** (from earlier branch):
- Enhanced documentation organization
- Improved link validation
- Better error handling in doc scripts
- Dynamic subfolder support

**Status**: This work was successfully merged and is working well.

## Performance Impact

### Before Changes:
- `full-close` recipe: ~5-10 seconds
- Commands executed quickly and reliably

### After Changes:
- `full-close` recipe: Hung indefinitely
- `feature-branch-workflow`: Never completed successfully
- Basic commands became unresponsive

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Over-Engineering**: Added too much complexity with interactive modes and wait loops
2. **Early Execution**: Scripts ran git commands before checking dry-run flag
3. **Poor MCP Integration**: Didn't account for non-interactive environment properly
4. **Breaking Changes**: Modified core scripts that other recipes depend on

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Incrementally**: Should have tested each script individually before creating recipe
2. **Respect Environment**: MCP environment has no TTY - design accordingly
3. **Performance First**: Avoid long-running operations in automation scripts
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality when adding features

## Files to Be Reverted

### New Files (to be deleted):
- `/scripts/git-pr-create.js`
- `/scripts/git-pr-status.js` 
- `/scripts/git-pr-merge.js`
- `/scripts/git-checkout-master.js`
- `/scripts/git-branch-new.js`

### Modified Files (to be reverted):
- `/config/recipes.json` - Remove feature-branch-workflow recipe
- `/config/registry.js` - Remove new script registrations
- `/scripts/test-runner.js` - Remove dry-run modifications
- `/scripts/git-pull.js` - Remove early dry-run return
- `/scripts/git-push.js` - Remove early dry-run return

## Rollback Target
- Commit: `23509f2` - "Merge pull request #11 from PeanutBAMM/feature/intelligent-doc-organization"
- This is the last known good state before the git workflow implementation

## Post-Rollback Actions
1. Clean up feature branches
2. Verify all existing recipes work correctly
3. Consider simpler approach for git workflow automation
